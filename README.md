I implemented an alarm clock with several functions.

**Inputs Explanation**
set_Clock - A 16-bit vector that represents the time we want to set in HEX format.
set_Alarm - A 16-bit vector that represents the **alarm** time we want to set in HEX format.
clk - 1KHz Clock.
reset - Turns off the alarm and sets the clock to 00:00.
off_Alarm - Turns off the alarm.
dur_Alarm - Sets the duration of the alarm in minutes (0-15).

**Outputs Explanation**
Clock - A 16-bit vector that represents the time in HEX format.
Alarm - Displays the alarm status (1 for an active alarm).




reset and initialization of initial values.
